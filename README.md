This is a basic app I created while doing the Android Studio course with Google.
You can download a working version of the app through the LemonAppDebug.apk.
The application will go through the stages of lemonade, while on stage 2 the app gives a random number as if to
simulate the pressure necessary to squeeze a lemon, or at least that's my take on it.

Please download and enjoy!
